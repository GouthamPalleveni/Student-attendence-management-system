## About the Project

The Student Attendance Management System is a Python-based project that utilizes various libraries such as pywhatkit, face_recognition, cv2, numpy, csv, datetime, and os to manage student attendance efficiently. The project employs face recognition technology to take attendance using a camera, and it records the attendance data in an Excel sheet. Additionally, the system has the capability to identify absent students and send absent notifications to their parents via WhatsApp.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Student Attendance Management System project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- Required libraries: pywhatkit, face_recognition, cv2, numpy.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kunal-kawate/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd Student-Attendance-Management-System
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```sh
   pip install pywhatkit face_recognition opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the project:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. The camera will start capturing faces for attendance.

3. The attendance data will be stored in an Excel sheet.

4. If any student is absent, their parents will receive an absent notification via WhatsApp.

## Features

- Face recognition-based attendance.
- Excel sheet records for attendance.
- Automatic notification for absent students via WhatsApp.

## How It Works

1. The system captures faces through the camera.
2. It uses face recognition to identify students.
3. Attendance is marked and recorded in an Excel sheet.
4. Absent students are identified and a WhatsApp notification is sent to their parents using pywhatkit.
